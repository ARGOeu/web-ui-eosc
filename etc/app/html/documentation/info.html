        <h1>Core Services</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">The first category 'Core Services' consists of 3 Service Groups
            <ol>
                <li>The Infrastructure Service Group</li>
                <li>The Homepage Service Group</li>
                <li>The Downstream Service Group</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="m-1">The above 3 Service Groups, should all be in 'OK' state simultaneously,
            in order for the Core Services to be considered in 'OK' state.</div>
        <div class="m-1">
            If one of these 3 Service Groups is in 'CRITICAL' state,  then Core Services are likewise considered in 'CRITICAL' state.
            Every one of these 3 Service Groups includes a number of Service Types, for achieving most accurate monitoring results.
        </div>
        <h3 class="mt-4">1. The Infrastructure Service Group</h3>

        <div class="m-1">The Downstream Service Group is responsible for monitoring the downstream services
            that enable the users to download the desired data
            and includes 4 Service Types

        <hr/>

        <h1>Other Services</h1>

        <div class="mt-4">The second category, that includes all the Services apart from the Core Services,
            consists of Service Groups that do not relate to each other.
        </div>
        <div class="m-1">
            As a result, if one Service Group is in 'CRITICAL' state
            then the other Service Groups are not affected by this result,
            as they operate and are monitored independently.
        </div>
    <div class="m-1">
        To check the Availability/Reliability of a Service Group,  you can generate a Custom Report in the following link
        <a href="https://monitoring.seadatanet.org/sdc/Critical/custom" title="link to custom report">https://monitoring.seadatanet.org/sdc/Critical/custom</a>
    </div>
        <div class="m-1">
        Along with the Service Group, you can select the time period you want information about it.
        After the Report is generated, you can export it in Excel, CSV or PDF format.
        </div>
        <div class="m-1">
        On the same link you can also check the Status of a Service Group, Service Type or metric,
        by generating a Custom Report, though in this scenario there is no way of exporting the report.

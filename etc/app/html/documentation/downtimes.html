    <h2><a name="main">Main feature</a></h2>
    <div>One of the most important features of the registry is the Downtime Calendar, through which users can inform others that a service will stop being active for a certain period of time.
   A downtime is a period of time for which a service is declared to be inoperable. Downtimes may be scheduled (e.g. for software/hardware upgrades), or unscheduled (e.g. power outages).
    All the features described in this document are available here : <a href="https://goc-sdc.argo.grnet.gr/">SDC GOCDB </a>
        All downtimes declared in GOC DB will be reflected into the ARGO system .
    </div>

            <h2><a name="set">Set a downtime period</a></h2>
            Adding a downtime period is very easy and simple, just going to the corresponding page and fill in the form fields.

            GOCDB stores the following information about downtimes (non exhaustive list):
            <ul>
                <li>The downtime classification (Scheduled or unscheduled)</li>
                <li>The severity of the downtime</li>
                <li>The date at which the downtime was added </li>
                <li>The start and end of the downtime period</li>
                <li>A description of the downtime</li>
                <li>The entities affected by the downtime</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Scheduled or unscheduled ?</strong>
            Depending on the planning of the intervention, downtimes can be:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scheduled:</strong> planned and agreed in advance</li>
                <li><strong>Unscheduled</strong>: planned or unplanned, usually triggered by an unexpected failure or at a short term notice
                </li>
            </ul>
                Please note:
                <ul>
                    <li>All dates have to be entered in UTC.</li>
                    <li>A downtime can be retrospectively added if its start-date is less than 48h in the past                      (giving a 2 day window to add).</li>
                    <li>downtime classification (scheduled/unscheduled) is determined automatically </li>
                </ul>
                The first thing you have to do is to select the "Add Downtime" on the menu on the left. (see image below)

                        <strong>Severity</strong>: When declaring a downtime, you will be presented the choice of a "severity", which can be either WARNING or OUTAGE. Please consider the following definitions:

                            <li> <strong>Outage </strong>: means the resource is considered as unavailable. Such downtimes will be considered as "IN MAINTENANCE" by monitoring and availability calculation tools.</li>
                            <li> <strong>Warning </strong>: means the resource is considered available, but the quality of service might be degraded. Such downtimes generate notifications, but are not taken into account by monitoring and availability calculation tools.</li>

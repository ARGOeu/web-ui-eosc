                    <p><strong>Availability</strong>: Service Availability is the fraction of time a service was in the UP Period during the known interval in a given period.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Service Reliability is the ratio of the time interval a service was UP over the time interval it was supposed (scheduled) to be UP in the given period.</p>

                    <p>From this page you can see the latest values for monthly repoorts for A/R for your infrastructure. A report is actually a configuration file that is used to describe the services you want to check, the metrics you want to use for each service and the grouping of the services. </p>


                     <p> The report may contain A/R values based on the group you chose in the Configuration Management Database :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Sites </strong>: List of services that participate in the site </li>
                        <li> <strong>Project</strong>: A list of services that are used in a project. </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>This is table with the main information. The Availability and Reliability values for the last 4 months. </p>

                <p>If you want o learn more about the daily availability or Reliability values of a specific month the only think you can do is to click on a value of Availability or Reliability (like option 1 or 2 in image 1 ).</p>

            <p>If you want to learn more about the services or the endpoints of the services you can clink on the name of the group you want (like option 3 in image 1 )  and drill down to other options. </p>

        <h3><a name="introStatus">Introduction</a></h3>
        This is the page where you may see the status for the whole infrastructure while at the same time you can drill down to services and service endpoints.<br/>

        <ul>Before we start some definitions about the services, service types and service endpoints.

            <li>From the ARGO monitoring service perspective, a monitored infrastructure is composed of <strong>service instances</strong> of specific <strong>Service Types</strong> running on specific <strong>endpoints</strong>, which are called <strong>Service Endpoints</strong>.</li>

            <li>A Service Type is a group of metrics that are checking a specific service from the monitoring perspective. So Each Service Type can have a defined set of metrics, which are explicit tests that we check in order to assess the status of a Service Endpoint.

        For example a Service Type of web server listening on port 443 on the host www.example.com, is a Service Endpoint. So a Service Endpoint is defined as the combination of an FQDN and Service Type.</li>

        <li>    Finally,  Each Service Type can have a defined set of metrics, which are explicit tests that we check in order to assess the status of a Service Endpoint.</li></ul>

        <h3><a name="landing">Status Page : landing page</a></h3>
        Î¤he first information you can see is about the groups you have (ex Services) . This page is automatically updated and it displays near real time information about the status of the groups.

        You may drill down to the services page and get more information about the services endpoints and finally about the metrics

        <h3><a name="statuscomputation">How is the status computed?</a></h3>

        The ARGO Analytics Engine expects to receive a stream of metric results produced by a monitoring engine.<br/>
        A metric result is the output of a specific test that was run at a specific time against a specific service endpoint.<br/>
        A metric result includes at least:
        <ul>
            <li>a timestamp showing when the given monitoring probe was executed</li>
            <li>the name of the service type (e.g. HTTPS Web Server)</li>
            <li>the name of the hostname on which the service is running (e.g. www.example.com)</li>
            <li>the name of the metric that was tested (e.g. TCP_CHECK)</li>
            <li>the status result that was produced by the monitoring probe (e.g. OK)</li>


        </ul>

        An example metric result in is shown below:<br/>
<pre class="text-danger border border-light col-4">
 {
    "timestamp": "2019-05-02T10:53:38Z",
    "metric": "org.web.check-tcp",
    "service_type": "HTTPS Web Server",
    "hostname": "www.example.com",
    "status": "OK"
}
</pre>
